*************************************************************************************************************
Nebula is a biological circuit design tool composed of Interactive Part & Automatic Part. We classified the parts released in 2013 and constructed a database for users to choose what they want. 
Transpeeder is a tool for mutating gene sequence based on alignment against SD sequence of host （e.g. in E.coli）. Transpeeder will help users increase or decrease the translation speed in ways of mutating gene sequence. Stand-alone version of Transpeeder is written in Java. And we also provide it online on http://cefg.cn/transpeeder.
