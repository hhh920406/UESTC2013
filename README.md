*************************************************************************************************************
Nebula is a biological circuit design tool composed of Auto Mode & Manual Mode. We classified the parts released in 2013 and constructed a database for users to choose what they want. 

Transpeeder is a tool for designing devices with different translation speed via mutating gene sequence based on alignment against SD sequence of host (e.g. in E.coli). Transpeeder can help users to control the translation speed by mutating gene sequence. Stand-alone version of Transpeeder is written in Java. And we also provide it online on http://cefg.cn/transpeeder.

iBricks is a video game concerning synthetic biology on iPhone.
